# Challenges & Lessons Learned

One of the main challenges I face is understanding large amounts of raw data, especially during traffic analysis.

At times, it is difficult to distinguish between normal and abnormal behavior without enough context.

If I say that these challenges motivate me, it will not be true, but nothing comes easy. 

I am learning to:
- Be patient during analysis
- Break problems into smaller steps
