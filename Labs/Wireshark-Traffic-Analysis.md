# Wireshark Traffic Analysis – TryHackMe

## Objective
Analyze network traffic using Wireshark to identify protocols, suspicious activity, and communication patterns.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- PCAP files
- Display filters

## What I Did
- Opened and analyzed PCAP files
- Applied display filters to isolate traffic (HTTP, DNS, TCP)
- Followed TCP streams to understand communication flows
- Identified abnormal and suspicious traffic patterns

## Challenges
- Understanding which filters to apply efficiently
- Interpreting raw packet data without context

## Key Takeaways
- Packet analysis requires both technical knowledge and analytical thinking
- Small details in traffic can reveal meaningful indicators
- Wireshark is a critical tool for SOC analysts
