# Wireshark Traffic Analysis – TryHackMe

## Objective
To analyze captured network traffic and identify relevant information and suspicious patterns using Wireshark.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- PCAP files
- Network protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP, ICMP)

## Tasks Performed
- Opened and analyzed PCAP files in Wireshark
- Applied display filters to isolate specific traffic
- Followed TCP streams to reconstruct sessions
- Analyzed DNS and HTTP traffic
- Identified abnormal or suspicious communication patterns

## Challenges
- Choosing the correct display filters
- Understanding protocol behavior at packet level
- Interpreting traffic without full context

## Key Takeaways
- Packet-level visibility provides deep insight into network behavior
- Good protocol knowledge is essential for traffic analysis
- Attention to detail is critical during investigations
